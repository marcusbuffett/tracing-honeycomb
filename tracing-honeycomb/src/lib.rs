//! This crate provides:
//! - A tracing layer, `TelemetryLayer`, that can be used to publish trace data to honeycomb.io
//! - Utilities for implementing distributed tracing against the honeycomb.io backend
//!
//! As a tracing layer, `TelemetryLayer` can be composed with other layers to provide stdout logging, filtering, etc.

/// data, which is individual spans on each trace. This means that using the
/// sampling logic in libhoney may result in missing event data or incomplete
/// traces. Calling this function provides trace-level sampling, meaning sampling
/// decisions are based on a modulo of the traceID, and events in a single trace
/// will not be sampled differently. If the trace is sampled, then all spans
/// under it will be sent to honeycomb. If a trace is not sampled, no spans or
/// events under it will be sent. When using this trace-level sampling, the
/// `sample_rate` parameter on the `libhoney::Config` should be set to 1, which
/// is the default.
